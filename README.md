# Code Example CMPT 350

This project contains the source code presented in my guest lecture of CMPT 350 on April 6th 2018.

If you questions about how something works or how this code might be extended or imporoved I encourage you to open an issue here and I'll do my best to respond.


## Getting the project running

You'll need to have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once you have that clone the repository and then in the root directory run:
`npm install`
to install the dependencies.

Then run `npm start` to start the local decelopment server.
